#Python basics

#Data types - 3
    #String - set of letters - ex-a,b,c,d.they are between quotation marks("string")
    #integer - set of number -1,2,3
    #float - set of numbers with decimal point -1.2,6.453

#Arthimetic operation-works on integer and float
    #addition (+)
        1 + 2 
    #subtraction (-)
        1 - 2
    #multiplication(*)
        1*2
    #divison (/) -gives quotient and remainder
        1/2
    #modulus (%) -gives only remainder
        2%!
    #floor divison (//) -gives only the integer of qoutient
        3//2
    #exponent (**)
        3**2
    #roots (**1/2)
        4**1/2

#Variables -they are case sensitive
    #Giving variable a value (words,numbers float)
        a = 12
        b = 13
    #variables can be operated just like numbers example-
        x = 12
        y = 3
        '''x + y = 15
           x - y  = 9
           x*y = 36
           x/y = 4  '''
    #variables can have string,number and float as value
        name = yashu
        age = 10
        b = 1.23

#input() - takes in input from user
    #we mostly give the input as a variable 
       name = input("Enter your name")
    #we can specify which type of data we want to take ie-string,integer,float.default will allow all
        age = int(input("enter  your age"))

#print() - prints the value .we can give it string,integer,foat,variable,operation,etc
    #example
        print("hello")
        print(a)
        print(1**2)

#bolean - true or false
    #we can check if something is true
    '''
    == when  both are equal
    != when they are not equal
    <= when right is greater
    >= when left is greater
    '''

#functions - pack the operation in one for using multiple times
def name()
        Name = aaryaveer
        print(name)
